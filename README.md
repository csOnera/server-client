This is a template for server-client communication without showing the key to connection of mongodb.
Simple UI.
In client side, react was used as the front-end framework and axios was used to fetch data by calling the specific uri according to the server routing (GET method).
In server side, express was used as the back-end framework while mongodb was used as the online database.
